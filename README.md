<br>Very simple GTK client for HiberHub.

## Behaviour:
- Clicking on `HiberLink`: It will take the link in your clipboard and post it on HiberLink (you can choose your instance through the variable `hiberlink`) and put the link in your clipboard.
- Clicking on `HiberFile`: It will open a file chooser  and upload the selected file to HiberFile (you can choose your instance through the variable `hiberfile`) and put the link in your clipboard.
